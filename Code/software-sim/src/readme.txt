The purpose of this simulator is the following:
1. Initial simulator to test software algorithms
2. Simulate moments that may be generated by off-canter fins during flight
3. Start sim at given altitude & velocity after motor burnout
4. Simulate reaction wheel. This includes angular acceleration, saturation, etc
